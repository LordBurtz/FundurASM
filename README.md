## Changes made
| Instruction | change |
| --- | ---|
| Alloc | Brand new command, it allocates space in the register. You know have to allocate space in your registry. The interpreter checks whether you are out of bounds or not. |
| End | New syntax: `END x` where `x` is a number referring to a cell in your registry. The content of that cell is the return code of the dispatched process. |

## The intention
This interpreter is written to help students in germany who use assembly-like code to get that code interpreted.
Please use with caution, at the moment only absolute filepaths are supported.
